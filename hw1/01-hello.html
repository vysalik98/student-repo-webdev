          I am Vysali Kallepalli. I'm a graduate student at PSU majoring in
          computer science. Before moving to Portland with my partner, I used to
          work in India. It is truly a blessing to be able to return to student
          life. I enjoy reading, painting, and cooking. I often experiment with
          different cuisines, but authentic Indian food will always be my
          favorite. I am enjoying my time here in Portland and looking forward
          to more experiences.
